Project Description: Machine Learning Approaches for Improved Situational Awareness and Threat Detection in Embedded IoT Systems
Overview
This project focuses on leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance situational awareness and threat detection in embedded Internet of Things (IoT) systems. The primary goal is to develop robust ML models that can process and analyze vast amounts of data generated by IoT devices to identify and mitigate potential security threats in real-time.
Key Components
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Utilized a comprehensive dataset from IoT devices, including various network traffic features and attack labels.
Implemented data cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as dropping irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and converting data types to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Feature Selection:
Employed techniques like ANOVA F-test and Chi-Squared test to identify the most significant features for threat detection.
Applied VarianceThreshold to remove constant features, enhancing the model's performance by focusing on the most informative attributes.
Model Development:
Developed multiple ML models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
Conducted hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
Ensemble Learning:
Created ensemble models such as Bagging, Boosting (AdaBoost), Stacking, and Gradient Boosting to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
Evaluated the performance of these models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Model Evaluation and Visualization:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure unbiased model evaluation.
Visualized the distribution of attack types and feature importances using tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Generated comprehensive classification reports and confusion matrices to assess model performance across different attack types.
Deployment and Real-Time Analysis:
Implemented the trained models on edge devices to enable real-time threat detection and situational awareness.
Utilized tools like joblib for model serialization and deployment, ensuring efficient and scalable implementation.
